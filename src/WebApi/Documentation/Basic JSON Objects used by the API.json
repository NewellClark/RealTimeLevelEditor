	A TileIndex is nothing more than a 2D integer point. It is used to keep track of the 
		positions of tiles and chunks, among other things.
	One thing to keep in mind is that in some circumstances, a tile index will be in "tile 
		units" (i.e. one unit = 1 tile), whereas in other circumstances, the numbers will be
		in "chunk units" (i.e. one unit = 1 chunk). More about this will be explained below.
